These are Smarty snippets for use with yasnippet.  To use these,
install nXhtml-mode and yasnippet, and then make sure you add the
following to your Emacs initialization file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.tpl$" . smarty-nxhtml-mumamo-mode))
#+end_src

All of the snippets are set up to be triggered only in smarty-mode, so
you will need to type the opening bracket and the trigger key in order
to activate them.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions, improvements, or
changes.  I know that the snippets are incomplete, but they represent
most of the things that I needed to do with Smarty at the time.
